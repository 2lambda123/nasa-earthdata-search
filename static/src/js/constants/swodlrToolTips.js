  GranuleExtent: 'There are two sizing options for raster granules: nonoverlapping square (256 km x 128 km). The rectangular granule extent is 64 km longer in along-track on both sides of the granule and can be useful for observing areas of interest near the along-track edges of the nonoverlapping granules without the need to stich sequential granules together.',
  MGRS: 'The Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) defines alphabetic Latitude bands. By default, UTM raster processing uses the MGRS band at the scene center. If a common grid is desired for scenes near each other , the band per scene can be adjusted (+/- 1 band) to allow nearby L@_HR_Raster outputs to be sampled on a common grid. This parameter has no effect if the output grid is not UTM.',
  UTM: 'The universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection is divided into 60 local zones 6 wide in Longitude. By default, UTM raster processing uses the UTM zone at the scene center. If a common grid is desired for scenes near each other , the zone per scene can be adjusted (+/- 1 zone)to allow nearby L2_HR_Raster outputs to be sampled on a common grid. This parameter has no effect if the output grid is not UTM.',
  RasterResolution: 'Resolution of the raster sampling grid in units of integer meters UTM grids and integer arc-seconds for latitude-longitude grids.',
  SamplingGridResolution: 'Specifies the type of the raster sampling grid. It can be either a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid or a geodetic latitude-longitude grid.'
